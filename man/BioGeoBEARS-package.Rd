  Summary: This package performs model-based statistical
  inference for historical biogeography. This includes
  inference of model parameters, ancestral states, and
  model comparison. Currently, the package performs ML
  (maximum-likelihood) based inference, but will soon be
  expanded to Bayesian analysis.

  Details: BioGeoBEARS allows probabilistic inference of
  both historical biogeography (ancestral geographic ranges
  on a phylogeny) as well as comparison of different models
  of range evolution.  It reproduces the model available in
  LAGRANGE (Ree and Smith 2008), as well as making
  available numerous additional models. For example,
  LAGRANGE as typically run has two free parameters, d
  (dispersal rate, i.e. the rate of range addition along a
  phylogenetic branch) and e (extinction rate, really the
  rate of local range loss along a phylogenetic branch).
  LAGRANGE also has a fixed cladogenic model which gives
  equal probability to a number of allowed range
  inheritance events, e.g.: (1) vicariance, (2) a new
  species starts in a subset of the ancestral range, (3)
  the ancestral range is copied to both species; in all
  cases, at least one species must have a starting range of
  size 1.  LAGRANGE assigns equal probability to each of
  these events, and zero probability to other events.
  BioGeoBEARS adds an additional cladogenic event:
  founder-event speciation (the new species jumps to a
  range outside of the ancestral range), and also allows
  the relative weighting of the different sorts of events
  to be made into free parameters, allowing optimization
  and standard model choice procedures to pick the best
  model. The relative probability of different descendent
  range sizes is also parameterized and thus can also be
  specified or estimated. The flexibility available in
  BioGeoBEARS also enables the natural incorporation of (1)
  imperfect detection of geographic ranges in the tips, and
  (2) inclusion of fossil geographic range data, when the
  fossils are tips on the phylogeny.
