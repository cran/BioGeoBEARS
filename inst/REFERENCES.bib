  abstract = {In historical biogeography, model-based inference methods for reconstructing the evolution of geographic ranges on phylogenetic trees are poorly developed relative to the diversity of analogous methods available for inferring character evolution. We attempt to rectify this deficiency by constructing a dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis (DEC) model for geographic range evolution that specifies instantaneous transition rates between discrete states (ranges) along phylogenetic branches and apply it to estimating likelihoods of ancestral states (range inheritance scenarios) at cladogenesis events. Unlike an earlier version of this approach, the present model allows for an analytical solution to probabilities of range transitions as a function of time, enabling free parameters in the model, rates of dispersal, and local extinction to be estimated by maximum likelihood. Simulation results indicate that accurate parameter estimates may be difficult to obtain in practice but also show that ancestral range inheritance scenarios nevertheless can be correctly recovered with high success if rates of range evolution are low relative to the rate of cladogenesis. We apply the DEC model to a previously published, exemplary case study of island biogeography involving Hawaiian endemic angiosperms in Psychotria (Rubiaceae), showing how the DEC model can be iteratively refined from inspecting inferences of range evolution and also how geological constraints involving times of island origin may be imposed on the likelihood function. The DEC model is sufficiently similar to character models that it might serve as a gateway through which many existing comparative methods for characters could be imported into the realm of historical biogeography; moreover, it might also inspire the conceptual expansion of character models toward inclusion of evolutionary change as directly coincident, either as cause or consequence, with cladogenesis events. The DEC model is thus an incremental advance that highlights considerable potential in the nascent field of model-based historical biogeographic inference.},

This is potentially confounding to comparative analyses of species distributions because current models do not allow reciprocal interactions between the evolution of ranges and the growth of phylogenetic trees. Here, we introduce a likelihood-based approach to estimating region-dependent rates of speciation, extinction, and range evolution from a phylogeny, using a new model in which these processes are interdependent. We demonstrate the method with simulation tests that accurately recover parameters relating to the mode of speciation and source-sink dynamics. We then apply it to the evolution of habitat occupancy in Californian plant communities, where we find higher rates of speciation in chaparral than in forests and evidence for expanding habitat tolerances.},

  abstract = {Classic questions about trait evolution--including the directionality of character change and its interactions with lineage diversification--intersect in the study of plant breeding systems. Transitions from self-incompatibility to self-compatibility are frequent, and they may proceed within a species ({"}anagenetic{"} mode of breeding system change) or in conjunction with speciation events ({"}cladogenetic{"} mode of change). We apply a recently developed phylogenetic model to the nightshade family Solanaceae, quantifying the relative contributions of these two modes of evolution along with the tempo of breeding system change, speciation, and extinction. We find that self-incompatibility, a genetic mechanism that prevents self-fertilization, is lost largely by the cladogenetic mode. Self-compatible species are thus more likely to arise from the isolation of a newly self-compatible population than from species-wide fixation of self-compatible mutants. Shared polymorphism at the locus that governs self-incompatibility shows it to be ancestral and not regained within this family. We demonstrate that failing to account for cladogenetic character change misleads phylogenetic tests of evolutionary irreversibility, both for breeding system in Solanaceae and on simulated trees.},

  pages = {195-203},
  abstract = {Quantification in historical biogeography has usually been based on the search for a single branching relationship among areas of endemism. Unlike organisms, however, areas rarely have a unique hierarchical history. Dispersal barriers appear and disappear and may have different effects on different species. As a result, the biota of an area may consist of several components with separate histories, each of which may be reticulate rather than branching. In an attempt to address these problems, I present a new biogeographic method, dispersal-vicariance analysis, which reconstructs the ancestral distributions in a given phylogeny without any prior assumptions about the form of area relationships. A three-dimensional step matrix based on a simple biogeographic model is used in the reconstruction. Speciation is assumed to subdivide the ranges of widespread species into vicariant components; the optimal ancestral distributions are those that minimize the number of implied dispersal and extinction events. Exact algorithms that find the optimal reconstruction(s) are described. In addition to their use in taxon biogeography, the inferred distribution histories of individual groups serve as a basis for the study of general patterns in historical biogeography, particularly if the relative age of the nodes in the source cladograms is known.},

Four types of models are being explored in the literature: (a) diffusion models, (b) island models, (c) hierarchical vicariance models (HVMs), and (d) reticulate models. Diffusion models are used primarily for phylogeographic inference but can also offer insights into geographic discontinuities of significance on longer time scales. For the island models, statistical approaches are now well developed and typically offer more detailed insight than parsimony analysis. In contrast, parsimony may still be the best option for HVM analysis, because existing statistical approaches do not yet accommodate dispersal. The proposed probabilistic models of reticulate scenarios remain poorly understood, even though they may currently do the best job of integrating diversification processes into biogeographic analysis. Statistical approaches are gaining in popularity across the field, in part because of the flexibility of stochastic modeling. This allows investigators to address important related processes, such as ecological interactions and climate change, in biogeographic inference.},

  abstract = {The ecological context of large-scale evolutionary patterns has been neglected. Several workers have recently reported a bathymetric bias in the evolution of benthic marine communities, such that nearshore assemblages tend to contain advanced taxa and community structures and offshore assemblages contain more archaic features. A clade-by-clade analysis is the most powerful approach for assessing the generality of the pattern and testing hypotheses on underlying mechanisms. We develop a paleoenvironmental framework for constructing time-environment histories for higher taxa that should be of general comparative utility, based on five environmental categories recognized by physical sedimentary and biostratinomic criteria. The robustness of negative data (absence of a given taxon from a particular time and environment) is evaluated using taphonomic control groupshigher taxa with ecological, morphological, and mineralogical properties similar to those of the group under study. Within this framework we have constructed three detailed time-environment histories from the primary literature, for the crinoid Order Isocrinida (based on 99 early Triassic-Recent occurrences), the bryozoan Order Cheilostomata (67 late Jurassic-late Eocene occurrences), and the bivalve Superfamily Tellinacea (70 late Triassic-Miocene occurrences). These three time-environment diagrams as well as numerous anecdotal reports suggest that the onshore-offshore trends previously reported for communities are actually underlain by individualistic clade histories that only appear to act in concert when viewed on a coarse time scale. For these three particular higher taxa differences in rates and timing of movement through environments also falsify causal hypotheses that invoke sea-level fluctuations or mass extinctions. We outline remaining viable hypotheses for driving mechanisms and suggest further tests; at present the data are consistent with a broad array of intrinsic biological mechanisms. These pervasive shifts through time of environmental preferences severely undermine approaches to paleoenvironmental reconstruction based on interpreting fossil content in the light of present-day faunal distributions. Production of detailed timeenvironment histories for additional higher taxa will permit paleoenvironmental analyses based on overlapping environmental range zones, in which particular co-occurrences are diagnostic of different habitats at different times.},

It implements several methods for estimating these parameters ranging from fairly standard maximum likelihood methods in the context of global or local molecular clocks to more experimental semiparametric and nonparametric methods that relax the stringency of the clock assumption using smoothing methods. Its starting point is a given phylogenetic tree and a given set of estimated branch lengths (numbers of substitutions along each branch). In addition one or more calibration points can be added to permit scaling of rates and times to real units. These calibrations can take one of two forms: assignment of a fixed age to a node, or enforcement of a minimum or maximum age constraint on a node, which is generally a better reflection of the information content of fossil evidence. Terminal nodes are permitted to occur at any point in time, allowing investigation of rate variation in phylogenies such as those obtained from {"}serial{"} samples of viral lineages through time. Finally, it is possible to assign all divergence times (perhaps based on outside estimates of divergence times) and examine molecular rate variation under several models of smoothing.

Here we develop a new stochastic model, which explicitly captures the dependency implied by a precursor and permits estimation of precursor locations. We apply it to the evolution of extrafloral nectaries (EFNs), an ecologically significant trait mediating a widespread mutualism between plants and ants. In legumes, a species-rich clade with morphologically diverse EFNs, the precursor model fits the data on EFN occurrences significantly better than conventional models. The model generates explicit hypotheses about the phylogenetic location of hypothetical precursors, which may help guide future studies of molecular genetic pathways underlying nectary position, development, and function.},

Until very recently we have relied on parsimony to infer character changes. Parsimony has a number of serious limitations that are drawbacks to our understanding. Recent statistical methods have been developed that free us from these limitations enabling us to overcome the problems of parsimony by accommodating uncertainty in evolutionary time, ancestral states, and the phylogeny.RESULTS:SIMMAP has been developed to implement stochastic character mapping that is useful to both molecular evolutionists, systematists, and bioinformaticians. Researchers can address questions about positive selection, patterns of amino acid substitution, character association, and patterns of morphological evolution.CONCLUSION:Stochastic character mapping, as implemented in the SIMMAP software, enables users to address questions that require mapping characters onto phylogenies using a probabilistic approach that does not rely on parsimony. Analyses can be performed using a fully Bayesian approach that is not reliant on considering a single topology, set of substitution model parameters, or reconstruction of ancestral states. Uncertainty in these quantities is accommodated by using MCMC samples from their respective posterior distributions.},

  journal = {Society of Vertebrate Paleontology Annual Meeting, November 2011, Las Vegas},
  abstract = {A new phylogenetic method of inference in historical biogeography, dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis (DEC), currently implemented in Lagrange, is beginning to be employed in studies of extinct taxa. This maximum-likelihood method reconstructs the ancestral range of lineages and estimates rates of dispersal and extinction along time-scaled branches. However, the method was primarily designed for molecular-derived ultrametric trees in which all taxa are extant, and it typically underestimates extinction rate and can overestimate vicariance and ancestral range size. Here we test the utility of DEC in analyses that include fossils. Specifically, we use databases such as MIOMAP to include the geographic range of fossil mammals in the DEC analysis, through a modification of DEC that adds each fossil species extant in each North American Land Mammal Age onto the phylogeny with a short branch.  Furthermore, following preliminary studies which showed that DEC does not treat branch endings as extinctions, we modified DEC to recognize branch tips as extinction events.  We find that the inclusion of fossils in a DEC analysis improves the biogeographic reconstruction through more realistic estimates of extinction rate, and more precise estimates of biogeographic history. These analyses were conducted on a variety of clades with available high-resolution phylogenies of fossil and extant specIes. These included an extinct clade of equids, extinct and extant clades of canids, and a clade of marmots including extinct and extant species.},
